## üì¶ Features
- **Hierarchical Planning:** This module uses both TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) for order selection and A* algorithm for pathfinding.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use, no technical knowledge is required.
- **Optimized Routes:** Efficiently calculates the best inspection paths, saving time and resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements
To run TSP-A_star, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.14 or higher, or any Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB.
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of available space.
- **Software:** Install a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
TSP-A_star operates on two main levels:

- **Upper Level (TSP)**: Determines the order of inspection for each turbine. You specify the turbines you wish to inspect, and the tool will calculate the best order to minimize travel time.

- **Lower Level (A*)**: Plans the path connecting each selected turbine. This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest route, ensuring quick access to every turbine in the shortest possible time.

## üìä User Guide
- **Select Wind Turbines**: Start by inputting the turbine locations into the application. You can input data manually or upload a pre-made CSV file.
- **Run Pathfinding**: Initiate the pathfinding process. The tool will take a moment to calculate.
- **View Results**: Once completed, the application will display the best path and order of inspections. You can view the results on the map interface within TSP-A_star.

## üé® User Interface
The user interface is designed for clarity and ease of navigation:
- **Map View**: Visual representation of turbines and planned routes.
- **Input Fields**: Simple fields to input turbine data.
- **Result Display**: Clear view of planned inspection order and routes.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
